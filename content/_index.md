## What you will find here

This space aims to provide some insights on the mathematical foundations that support what we call nowadays *Artificial Intelligence*. Our idea is to provide a theoretical toolset that allows you to, not only understand every step of the operational processes that make this system work, but also to gain some philosophical perspective about the unique situation the computer science world is involved right know. To describe it shortly, we name these systems *Artificially intelligent* though there is not a comprehensive (or non-comprehensive for that matter) theory on what it means to be **intelligent**. 


With time, we will also try to cover the implications that this new technological framework has meant for other areas of information technology. This is the case of Cypersecurity or Software development at the point of redefining the human-computer interaction. We hope you enjoy the ride.
